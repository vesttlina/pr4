    <h2><u>Instructions</u></h2>
    <h3>Strawberry Jam</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the chopped strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice to a saucepan.</li>
        <li>Cook the strawberries, stirring occasionally, at medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>When the strawberries come to a boil, turn the heat down and continue to cook at medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Cook until a thermometer reads between 200 and 220ºF. The jam will be dark, and thick. If it starts to stick to the bottom of the pan, turn the heat down even lower.</li>
        <li>If you don’t have a thermometer, simply stop cooking them jam once it is dark, thick, and reduced.</li>
        <li>Remove the jam to a bowl, place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the jam, and let it cool down. Refrigerate for a couple of hours before using.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Strawberry Syrup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the jam and the liqueur (or juice if substituting). Whisk until combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>You can use strawberry juice, orange juice, or Grand Marnier instead of strawberry liqueur.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Mascarpone Filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the mascarpone cheese with 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, the lemon juice, and the vanilla extract using an electric mixer, at medium speed. The mascarpone can be straight from the fridge, no need to let it become softened. Beat just until combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whip the cold heavy whipping cream with the remaining 1/4 cup of powdered sugar for 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly stiff peaks form. Don’t over whip.</li>
        <li>Add half of the whipped cream to the mascarpone, and fold to combine.</li>
        <li>Then add the remaining half of the whipped cream, fold again.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To assemble</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dip each ladyfinger in the Strawberry Syrup, and lay them on the bottom of the pan one next to the other.</li>
        <li>Top the ladyfingers with half of the Mascarpone Filling. Use a small offset spatula to spread the filling evenly.</li>
        <li>Drizzle about 1/2 cup of jam on top of the mascarpone. If the jam is too thick and not spreading easily, simply add a bit of water or strawberry liqueur until the jam has a spreading consistency.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle chopped strawberries evenly on top of the jam.</li>
        <li>Now make another layer of ladyfingers on top of the chopped strawberries.</li>
        <li>Dip each ladyfinger in the syrup, and place on top of the layered dessert. Push down gently on the cookies as you place them on top of the strawberries.</li>
        <li>Top the cookies with the remaining half of the Mascarpone Filling.</li>
        <li>Let the tiramisu sit in the fridge overnight.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Before serving, make the whipped cream for the top. Simply whip the heavy cream for a couple of minutes at medium-high speed, or until stiff peaks form. Place it in a piping bag. This is optional, you only have to top the tiramisu with whipped cream if you wish to do so. You can get creative and do a different decoration.</li>
        <li>Pulse the freeze dried strawberries in a small food processor until they become a fine powder.</li>
        <li>Sift the freeze dried strawberry powder on top of the tiramisu. Pipe whipped cream around the edges, and top with fresh strawberries if desired.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
