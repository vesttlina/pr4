    <h5>William Shakespeare (bapt.Tooltip baptised 26[a] April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616)[b] was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded <br>as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[3][4][5] He is often called England's national poet and the <br> "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, <br>and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often <br>than those of any other playwright.[6] Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be <br>studied and reinterpreted. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway,<br> with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London <br>as an actor, writer, and part-owner ("sharer") of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men after the <br>ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three <br>years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, <br>his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and even certain fringe theories[7] as to whether the works attributed to him were written by others.[8][9][10]</h5> 
    <h5>Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.[11][12] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded <br> as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, <br>and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language.[3][4][5] In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies <br>(also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy <br>during his lifetime. However, in 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, published a more definitive <br> text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its Preface was <br>a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, that hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: "not of an age, but for all time".[13]</h5>
